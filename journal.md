<p>I steal some HTML from lab 5 for boilerplate </p>
<p>I steal css grid from https://codepen.io/MSEdgeDev/pen/mMQqZX I liked the look of this grid as it looked easy to understand and work with and fit what I had made in wireframe</p>
<p> I succesfully changed the css grid to suit my needs, the original had column called "aside" that I didn't need. Hopefully this doesn't affect the responsiveness</p>
<p> I also wasted some time because everytime I went live, I was taken to the directory. The solution was in the html files I had the stylesheet pointing to the wrong folder, I will not make this mistake again.(https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68571097/96407342-a70ec480-123d-11eb-89b4-3da51c67e403.PNG)</p>

<p> Had small problem, once the header, footer, and nav were completeed I copied the code from home to about, payment, and products. However the css and css grid were not displaying, the solution was the stlyesheet folders needed to be directed at the new folders </p>
<p> Am using the code from w3 schols https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp for the image slideshow on the landing page, however currently whenever I go live all is displayed is the dots and arrows, am just gonna play around with code to see if it can be fixed, I'm sure it's just something that's in the wrong place or isn't linked up properly</p>
<p> I guess part of the issue was that I'd forgetten to add in the javascript. I've now added the js code however, I need to figure out how to apply it to just the section part of the grid I think, as the home page is now filled with massive image placeholders and it looks heccin bad.. Also the images are stacked on one another as opposed to a slider, so more tinkering is needed for sure. </p>
<p> I was incorrect here, after speaking with Ali, the Java script was working incorrectly, however the slider was sitting in the grid correctly, it just looked horrid. </p>

<p>Typos were removed and now I'm back to having just the arrows and dots? I have added in an image link however it's not displaying and I'm so confused.</p>
<p> Have sent code for the image slider to Ali as there is an issue in the js where the slider doens't load and display without being interacted with </p>
<p> Found this really nice code on code pen for an image grid! https://codepen.io/Ketziel/pen/tcCxK however after I changed the size of it to fill the section it overlapped the footer so I had to change the footer position to sticky, depending on how the content for the rest of the pages sits, I might change this for all pages. </p>
<p> after completing my image grid and zooming I realised that the responsiveness of my footer is still not the best? My image grid slips behind it and shows underneath it.. Have screenshot</p>
![No sticky](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68571097/95934860-5d357100-0e2e-11eb-88ab-afaa0c1a0271.PNG)
<p> After asking Daniels opinion of the footer, we decided that it's the image grid I used that isn't responding properly</p>
<p> I fixed! by changing the overflow in the .imageGridPercentage to auto</p>
<p> remembered to add cart icon, however it completely ruined my image grid and basically this thing is the bane of my existence.</p>
<p> I have decided, against my better judgement and after Ali had told me not to, I will be putting the cart icon in the header. I think this will be okay, I just can't figure out how to have it in the section without ruining my content </p>
<p> put the cart in the header and it absolutely ruined my header. Ali is gonna fix for me :3</p>
<p> using https://htmlcheatsheet.com/css/ to generate lil buttons for the payment page!! however css wasn't working so had to change from id to class and it worked? Will not question it, as long as it works</p>
<p> code for checkbox on payment page https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_custom_checkbox.asp </p>
<p> I realised that I have strayed from my mockup regarding the side nav. Initially I had planned to have a hamburger menu that would display the hyperlinks to the other pages, however I deemed that too ambitious and decided on a static side nav. It also made sense since the css grid I had approriated already had space for a side nav <br> I also decided to have the header to the left hand side with the logo as I decided it just looked better! Same with the footer</p>
<p> Am using https://www.sessions.edu/color-calculator/ and used the Hexadecimal from the Jellyfish logo to find complimentary colors for th header, and after changing the header I'm considering changing the colors for the rest of the site..</p>
<p> I broke the nav links after I put icons next to them :(</p>
<p> That was a lie! It still works it just won't allow me to go from the products page to the about page? </p>
